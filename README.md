# KNOW ABOUT ME
Hey, I'm a Backend Developer currently working in Nter Tech Services, a Consulting Firm.

Up until now, I've had worked as a QA Automation Tester, but since September 2024, I have been focused in learning web and software development, focusing on a Backend role.

At the moment, I have worked for 2 different projects:
- A multi-use web for intern employees, in where I became experience in building APIs, working with Databases and become a solid Java-SpringBoot developer. My best feat was building an event driven architecture from scratch, working with Front end.
- A debt managment portal for a high value company. This time i learn a lot about planification, thinking ahead, be rigorous in my work and at the same time I learnt azure DevOps, CI/CD and become a better engineer, improving my strategy thinking, design and soft skills.
  
## 🔭 I’m currently working on ...

- [ ] Learn GoLang as a second Backend language
- [ ] Become a solid Java and SpringBoot Senior Backend Developer
- [ ] Grow into a Full Stack Software Engineer
- [ ] Develop my soft skills and leadership/planification in order to become a CTO one day
